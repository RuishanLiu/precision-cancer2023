Python codes for paper: Characterizing mutation-treatment effects using clinico-genomics data of 78,287 patients with 20 types of cancers (under review).


# Quick Guidance


### Main codes

In [main.ipynb](https://github.com/RuishanLiu/precision-cancer2023/tree/master/main.ipynb), we present our codes to analyze
- Association between mutations and patient survival.
- Gene-treatment interactions.
- Pathway-treatment interactions.
- RSF score for treatment.


### Synthetic Data

The synthetic data used as an illustration are provided in [synthetic_data.csv](https://github.com/RuishanLiu/precision-cancer2023/tree/master/synthetic_data.csv). The detailed descriptions are included in the notebook [main.ipynb](https://github.com/RuishanLiu/precision-cancer2023/tree/master/main.ipynb).
